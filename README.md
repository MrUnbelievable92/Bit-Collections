# Bit-Collections

Bit Collections for Unity is all about saving as much RAM(-bandwidth) as possible, by providing array value types of single bits, aswell as array value types of signed- and unsigned numbers with a given number of bits.

Since using less RAM usually comes at the cost of more time (CPU), this library uses SIMD instructions as much possible.

Additionally, 3- 5- 6- and 7-Bit Numbers are defined:

... Which Work (almost) Just Like Normal Integers:
